    XLA, which stands for Accelerated Linear Algebra, is a domain-specific compiler,
    developed by Google, designed to optimize and accelerate the execution of the core
    linear algebra operations commonly used in machine learning and other numerical
    computing tasks. XLA is often associated with the TensorFlow, where it is used to
    improve the performance of TensorFlow models, and more recently, combined with an
    autograd engine, forms the backbone of JAX. The primary goal of XLA is to take
    high-level mathematical operations defined in the frontend framework and compile
    them into optimized low-level code that can be executed on various hardware
    accelerators, such as GPUs and TPU, which XLA was specifically designed to support.
    Its pipeline consists of decomposing the input program into a fixed set of high
    level operations (HLO), then performing a series of target-independent optimization
    passes, such as weight update sharding or kernel fusion, on this HLO IR, before
    offloading to device specific libraries like CuDNN for Nvidia GPUs or Eigen for
    CPUs, for handling hardware-dependent optimizations. Though originally built with a
    unique IR syntax, over the years XLA has gradually integrated MLIR into its
    compilation pipeline, providing the ability to both import and export MLIR modules
    from its corresponding HLO dialects (MHLO, LHLO) as well as adding optimization
    passes written fully in MLIR. In 2022, Google fully open sourced XLA, moving it to a
    new repository independent of Tensorflow, and created the OpenXLA foundation to
    continue its support and broaden the ecosystem with the development of new tools
    such as StableHLO, a backwards-compatible MLIR dialect for representing HLO ops,
    and IREE.
