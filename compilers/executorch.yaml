    ExecuTorch: ExecuTorch is an end-to-end solution that enables on-device inference
    capabilities across mobile and edge devices. At a high level, it is a more robust
    version of PyTorch Mobile, which used TorchScript for deployment on edge devices.
    However, with PyTorch 2.0, it is no longer preferred to use TorchScript, and
    ExecuTorch replaces it with torch.compile and torch.export. One of the major
    benefits of ExecuTorch is that it defines a list of standardized operators, which
    reduces the surface that needs to be covered by third-party operator libraries and
    accelerator backends. ExecuTorch has also received backing from industry leaders
    like Meta, Arm, Apple, and Qualcomm.

  features:
    - "Efficient Execution on Edge"
    - "Robust Export Technology"
    - "Direct Device Deployment"
    - "Customization for Performance"
    - "Operator Standardization"
