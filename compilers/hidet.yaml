    Hidet is an open-source deep learning compiler, primarily written in Python,
    designed for end-to-end compilation of deep neural network (DNN) models from
    frameworks like PyTorch and ONNX into efficient CUDA kernels, specifically optimized
    for NVIDIA GPUs. It focuses on providing high performance through graph-level
    optimizations and operator-level kernel tuning. Hidet is characterized by its ease
    of use, allowing for easy integration of DNN models for inference, and its
    extensibility, enabling users to add new operators and fusion patterns to suit their
    specific needs.

  features:
    - "End-to-End Model Compilation"
    - "Python-Centric Development"
