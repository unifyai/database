    NVIDIA's Apex is a set of tools designed to simplify and optimize mixed precision
    and distributed training in PyTorch. It was created to provide utilities like
    Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) and Distributed Training functionalities to users
    more rapidly than the official PyTorch releases. Although parts of Apex, such as
    apex.amp for AMP and apex.parallel.DistributedDataParallel for optimized
    multi-process distributed training, have been deprecated in favor of PyTorch's
    native features, the library offered functionalities like synchronized Batch
    Normalization and a custom checkpointing system for training states. Apex has been
    instrumental in improving performance and memory usage for deep learning models on
    NVIDIA GPUs

  features:
    - "Automatic Mixed Precision"
    - "Optimized Distributed Training"
