    tinygrad is a complete, mini deep learning framework, with syntax very similar to
    that of PyTorch, however, unlike Torch, it is by default lazily compiled and is
    built on top of a minimalist op set, claiming: “Due to its extreme simplicity, it
    aims to be the easiest framework to add new accelerators to, with support for both
    inference and training. If XLA is CISC, tinygrad is RISC.” Though supporting a wide
    range of hardware, its parent company, TinyCorp, is especially focusing on providing
    top tier support for AMD GPUs, which it plans on using as the base of its local deep
    learning compute cluster, tinybox.

  features:
    - "Simplicity in Design"
    - "Kernel Fusion with Laziness"
    - "Extensive Accelerator Support / Easy Integration"
