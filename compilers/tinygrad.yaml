  description: "tinygrad is a complete, mini deep learning framework, with syntax very similar to that of PyTorch, however, unlike Torch, it is by default lazily compiled and is built on top of a minimalist op set, claiming: “Due to its extreme simplicity, it aims to be the easiest framework to add new accelerators to, with support for both inference and training. If XLA is CISC, tinygrad is RISC.” Though supporting a wide range of hardware, its parent company, TinyCorp, is especially focusing on providing top tier support for AMD GPUs, which it plans on using as the base of its local deep learning compute cluster, tinybox."

  features:
    - "Simple low-level opset"
    - "Easy accelerator integration"
