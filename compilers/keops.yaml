  description: |
    KeOps (Kernel Operations) is a library designed to boost tensor computations by
    leveraging mathematical structure common in machine learning and applied
    mathematics, like distance matrices, kernel matrices, and point cloud convolutions.
    It utilizes symbolic tensors, which are efficient mathematical formulations,
    supporting operations with CPU and GPU integration. KeOps is memory-efficient,
    offering significant speed-ups to GPU programs, supports automatic differentiation,
    and has a linear memory footprint. It integrates well with standard packages and
    supports multi-GPU configurations.

  features:
    - "Reduction of Large Arrays"
    - "Symbolic Tensor Operations"
    - "Automatic Differentiation"
