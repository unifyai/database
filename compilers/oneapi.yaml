    OneAPI is Intel's comprehensive toolkit for developing and optimizing applications
    across diverse computing architectures such as CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. It's built
    around a unified programming model that aims to future-proof software development by
    allowing a single codebase to span multiple types of hardware. The toolkit includes
    advanced compilers, powerful libraries, and migration tools that facilitate the
    transition from proprietary code (like CUDA) to an open, standards-based workflow.
    OneAPI stands out for its emphasis on ease of use, performance optimization, and its
    broad support for heterogeneous computing, making it a versatile choice for
    developers targeting Intel's hardware ecosystems.

  features:
    - "Efficient Parallelism"
    - "Optimized Python Distributio"
    - "Migration of CUDA Code"
