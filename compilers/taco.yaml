    TACO, which stands for Tensor Algebra Compiler, is a library and compiler,
    specializing in its support for a wide range of tensor computations and storage
    formats. It automates the generation of efficient kernels which can compete with
    hand-written ones, and, uniquely at the time of its inception, its operands may be
    either fully dense, fully sparse, or a mix of the two.

  features:
    - "Extensive Tensor Format Support"
    - "Able to Mix Dense and Sparse Representations"
    - "OpenMP for Portable Parallelism"
