    IREE, which stands for Intermediate Representation Execution Environment, is an MLIR
    based compiler and runtime stack specifically designed to be able to scale down to
    meet the tight constraints of mobile and edge deployment, while still retaining the
    ability to scale up to more traditional, large scale settings like datacenters and
    compute clusters. IREE provides an end-to-end compilation pipeline, ranging from
    high level optimizations similar to XLA, all the way down to a Hardware Abstraction
    Layer (HAL) which generates device specific code. IREE has taken much inspiration
    from, and integrates seamlessly with Vulkan, a popular cross-platform GPU API which
    uses SPIR-V, a standardized binary intermediate language for GPUs. One of IREEâ€™s
    greatest strengths is the high degree of modularity that it provides due to its
    utilization of a different MLIR dialect for each layer of abstraction, from
    tensor-based input dialects such as StableHLO, TOSA and Torch-MLIR, to internal
    dialects handling low-level tasks such as dataflow analysis, partitioning and
    scheduling. IREE stands as being the most robust end-to-end compiler/runtime stack
    built fully around MLIR, providing a concrete example of its utility.
