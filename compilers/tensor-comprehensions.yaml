    Tensor Comprehensions (TC) is a C++ library, developed by Meta, that automates the
    synthesis of high-performance machine learning kernels. It leverages Halide, ISL
    (Integer Set Library), and either NVRTC or LLVM to produce efficient code. A key
    feature of TC is its framework-agnostic nature, meaning it is designed to work with
    different machine learning frameworks without being tied to any one of them
    specifically. TC introduces an Einstein notation based language, making its syntax
    more closely aligned with the mathematics of deep learning. This language is used
    within a polyhedral Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that translates a mathematical
    description of a deep learning DAG into a CUDA kernel. TC simplifies the process of
    writing high-performance GPU code by generating code from a high-level language and
    then auto-tuning that code for specific input sizes, making it easier for developers
    to achieve optimized performance without deep expertise in GPU programming.

  features:
    - "Einstein Notation for Tensor Operations"
    - "Autotuner for Optimization"
    - "Easy Framework Integration"
