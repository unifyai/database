    Mojo is not just a compiler, but rather an entirely new programming language
    recently introduced by Chris Latner’s (of LLVM fame) company, Modular. Offering a
    syntax nearly identical to that of Python, Mojo seeks to combine Python’s ease of
    use with the low-level control and runtime efficiency which languages like C and C++
    provide. Being a superset of Python, Mojo provides full interoperability with
    existing packages in the Python ecosystem such as pandas and matplotlib. Mojo also
    introduces a slew of new features which Python lacks, including type checking,
    ownership, SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) programming and even autotuning
    features to finetune parameters for optimal performance on one’s target hardware.
    Built on top of MLIR, Mojo also allows full extensibility and interoperability with
    any existing tools in the MLIR ecosystem, and can even be thought of as a
    programming language for MLIR, as it provides the ability to write custom MLIR code
    in a more user-friendly, Pythonic syntax. Along with this new language, Modular also
    provides an AI inference engine (written using Mojo kernels) which existing models
    written in PyTorch or Tensorflow can be easily ported to for efficient inference.
    Currently Mojo supports all CPU architectures and is planning on supporting GPUs and
    custom accelerators in the near future.

  features:
    - "Python Usability with C Performance"
    - "Parallel Heterogeneous Runtime"
    - "Language-Integrated Auto-tuning"
    - "Comprehensive MLIR Support"
