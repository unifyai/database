    Candle is a Rust-based, minimalist machine learning framework maintained by
    HuggingFace and designed to offer efficient serverless inference. Though recently
    developed, Candle already offers excellent support for efficient performance on both
    GPU and CPU, leveraging compute primitive libraries such as cuDNN for Nvidia GPUs
    and Intel MKL for CPUs, as well as providing the ability to easily add custom
    kernels for state-of-the-art algorithms like Flash-Attention. By removing all Python
    dependencies while retaining an easy to use, torch-like syntax, Candle can greatly
    improve the efficiency of the production workload and allow for the deployment of
    lightweight binaries. In addition to this, it also supports WASM, allowing models
    to be run fully in the browser.

  features:
    - "Efficient Serverless Inference"
    - "Lightweight Binaries"
    - "Easy Integration of HuggingFace Model Weights"
    - "WASM support"
