    IntelÂ® Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) is a powerful tool designed to optimize PyTorch
    performance specifically for Intel architecture, taking advantage of specialized
    instruction sets and acceleration units on Intel CPUs and GPUs. It enhances both
    eager and graph execution modes in PyTorch with custom modules, optimizers, and
    quantization APIs, while providing graph mode optimizations through extended fusion
    passes.
