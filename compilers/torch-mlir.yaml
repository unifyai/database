    Torch-MLIR is a project that seeks to bridge PyTorch with the MLIR (Multi-Level
    Intermediate Representation) ecosystem. As part of the LLVM Incubator process,
    Torch-MLIR is not yet an official part of LLVM releases but serves as a compiler
    support path from PyTorch to MLIR. Torch-MLIR enables hardware vendors to
    efficiently map PyTorch and other frameworks into MLIR, allowing for easier
    targeting of hardware-specific optimizations. The project supports several paths for
    lowering models to the Torch MLIR Dialect and then to existing MLIR dialects. On the
    PyTorch frontend, this includes TorchScript and LazyTensorCore, with the addition of
    support for TorchDynamo/PyTorch 2.0 in progress. On the backend, a variety of
    different lowering paths are supported for different use cases, the core ones being
    StableHLO, TOSA and Linalg (+ arith, tensor, etc).

  features:
    - "Seamless PyTorch-MLIR Integration"
    - "Multiple Lowering Paths"
