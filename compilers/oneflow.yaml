  description: |
    OneFlow is a deep learning framework that offers a unified solution for both deep learning 
    and traditional machine learning tasks. It stands out for its efficient approach to distributed 
    training, leveraging advanced parallelism and resource management techniques to optimize hardware 
    usage in large-scale environments. The framework supports both dynamic and static computation graphs, 
    providing users with the flexibility to choose the most suitable approach for their specific project. 
    Additionally, OneFlow utilizes MLIR for its codegen, with all modules being compiled to a Oneflow dialect 
    before lowering to device code. 

  features:
    - "Advanced Distributed Training Efficiency"
    - "Support for Both Dynamic and Static Graphs"
    - "Intuitive and User-Friendly API"
