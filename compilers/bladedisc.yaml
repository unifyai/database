  description: |
    BladeDISC, developed by Alibaba, is an open-sourced dynamic shape compiler designed
    to overcome the challenges associated with the static shape limitations of previous
    deep learning compilers. Leveraging MLIR, BladeDISC allows for dynamic shape
    semantics, providing a flexible and robust solution for AI computing tasks that
    require diverse input shapes and sizes.

  features:
    - "Specializes in Dynamic Shape Support"
    - "Lightweight API"
    - "Plugin Mode inside TensorFlow/PyTorch Runtime"
