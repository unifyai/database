  description: |
    FlexGen is a recently developed inference engine for LLMs designed to maximize
    throughput on a single commodity GPU. It uses a linear programming optimizer to
    navigate through a search space of offloading strategies in search of the most
    efficient ways to store and load tensors, as well as fine-grained, group-wise
    quantization to compress the weights and attention cache to 4 bits with negligible
    accuracy loss. One of FlexGen’s key contributions is the use of a “zig-zag” as
    opposed to row-by-row block schedule to more efficiently overlap I/O with
    computation. Through a combination of such strategies, FlexGen achieves
    significantly higher throughput than other state-of-the-art offloading methods.

  features:
    - "Fast Offloading"
    - "High Throughput on Single-Device Commodity GPU"
    - "IO and Computation Overlapping"
