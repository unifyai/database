    Though yet to have been fully released, PolyBlocks is a promising MLIR-based
    compiler engine which utilizes a modular, block-like structure of compiler passes,
    making it highly extensible and reusable for a variety of hardware architectures. As
    the name suggests, it specializes in the use of polyhedral optimization techniques,
    utilizing MLIRâ€™s affine dialect, as well as leveraging high-dimensional data spaces
    for compilation, supporting both Just-in-Time (JIT) and Ahead-of-Time (AOT)
    compilation and performing full codegen, making it fully independent of any
    third-party vendor libraries. Its benchmarks have shown performance which exceeds
    that of hand-written Nvidia libraries such as CuBLAS, CuDNN and TensorRT on A100
    GPUs.

  features:
    - "Modular Design"
    - "Advanced Code Generation"
    - "Simple Integration with Python Frameworks"
