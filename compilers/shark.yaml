  description: |
    SHARK is a high performance ML compiler and runtime, developed by Nod.ai, a
    performance focused AI startup recently acquired by AMD, specifically for
    accelerating PyTorch code. It is built using components from IREE and Torch-MLIR, an
    MLIR dialect for representing PyTorch operations, as well as an in-house, ML-based
    autotuner. SHARK has shown a number of promising features and results, including
    TorchDynamo integration, a hardware-agnostic implementation of the seminal
    Flash-Attention algorithm, and even exceeding the performance of OpenAI Triton while
    running Flash-Attention 2 on an A100 GPU.

  features:
    - "TorchDynamo Integration"
    - "Device-Agnostic FlashAttention"
