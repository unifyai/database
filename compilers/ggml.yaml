    GGML is a minimal, C-based tensor library focussed on providing efficient training
    and inference for popular models on commodity hardware, specifically Apple silicon.
    It has a number of features that make it ideal for edge deployment such as integer
    quantization ranging from 8-bit quantization all the way to 4-bit, no third-party
    dependencies, zero memory allocations at runtime, and support for WebAssembly and
    WASM SIMD for running in the browser.

  features:
    - "Optimized for Apple Silicon"
    - "Robust Quantization Support"
    - "Resource-Friendly"
    - "No third-party dependencies"
    - "Efficient CPU inference"
