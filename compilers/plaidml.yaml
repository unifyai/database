  description: |
    PlaidML is a tensor compiler, developed by Intel, specializing in running deep
    learning models on devices which are not typically well supported for such
    workloads, such as laptops and embedded devices. It is even able to generate Nvidia
    GPU code matching the performance of native libraries without having to go through
    CUDA. Recently it has adopted MLIR for the purpose of better extensibility and
    integration into the ever-growing MLIR ecosystem. PlaidML is also part of Intel's
    wider suite of deep learning tools, nGraph.

  features:
    - "Portable Tensor Compiler"
    - "Non-CUDA Acceleration for Nvidia Hardware"
