  description: |
    TensorRT is a high-performance deep learning inference library developed by NVIDIA.
    It is designed to optimize and accelerate the inference of deep neural networks for
    production deployment on NVIDIA GPUs. TensorRT is commonly used in applications that
    require real-time, low-latency, and high-throughput processing of deep learning
    models. Given the DAG of the model as an input, TensorRT creates its own DAG. Then
    it applies optimizations like operation fusion in kernel level and memory
    rearrangements to speed up the inference. It also eliminates redundant operations
    that either don’t contribute to the output or when removed they don’t change the
    final result. For example, if there are two successive reshape operations that
    cancel each other, both will be dropped during the optimization process. It supports
    dynamic shapes for inputs when models are simple like CNNs or MLPs. Internally it
    uses pre-compiled CUDA kernels from linear algebra and deep learning libraries like
    cuBLAS and cuDNN.

  features:
    - "Hardware-aware compilation"
    - "Runtime efficiency management"
    - "Tailored for safety-critical systems"
    - "Sparsity support"
