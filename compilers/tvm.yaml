    TVM, which stands for Tensor Virtual Machine, is an end-to-end compiler stack for
    deep learning, aiming to provide a comprehensive set of optimizations for a wide
    variety of hardware backends, including custom accelerators. It uses the same
    scheduling language model as that which was first introduced by Halide, allowing an
    algorithm to be defined separately from its scheduling logic. Unlike most DL
    compilers, which tend to be graph-based, TVMâ€™s Relay IR is a functional language
    with full support for common programming constructs such as conditionals and loops,
    giving it better support for more complex, dynamic models. TVM generates its own
    low-level, hardware specific code for a diverse set of backends and utilizes an
    ML-based cost model called AutoTVM which adapts and improves codegen based on
    continuous data collection. Recently it has been added as a backend of
    torch.compile.

  features:

    - "Novel Schedule Primitives"
    - "End-to-End Compilation Stack"
    - "Supported by TorchDynamo"
