  description: |
    Tiramisu is a polyhedral compiler designed to handle both dense and sparse deep
    learning and other data parallel algorithms. Its defining features include its
    flexible representation based on the polyhedral model, a rich scheduling language
    for precise control of optimizations, and a four-level intermediate representation
    that separates algorithms, loop transformations, data layouts, and communication.
    Tiramisuâ€™s polyhedral model allows it to stand out particularly in its optimization
    of RNNs and sparse nets, which are areas not typically as thoroughly addressed by
    other deep learning compilers.

  features:
    - "Complex Loop Transformations"
    - "Optimization of Sparse DNNs"
    - "Strong Support for RNNs"
