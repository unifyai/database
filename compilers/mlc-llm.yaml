    MLC LLM, which stands for Machine Learning Compilation for Large Language Models, is
    a framework aimed at high-performance and universal deployment of large language
    models. It leverages compiler acceleration to enable the native deployment of these
    models with native APIs across various devices. The framework is designed to
    facilitate the development, optimization, and deployment of AI models using machine
    learning compilation techniques. It offers capabilities to build and deploy
    applications across different platforms, including web, iOS, and Android, with
    support for multiple programming languages and APIs. Additionally, MLC-LLM provides
    tools for model compilation, distribution of compiled models, and model architecture
    definition.

  features:
    - "Universal Deployment"
    - "Cross-Platform Application Building"
