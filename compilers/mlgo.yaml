  description: |
    MLGO is a framework designed to optimize compiler processes within LLVM using
    machine learning techniques, specifically Policy Gradient and Evolution Strategies.
    It is distinctive for embedding machine learning models directly into the compiler
    to make key decisions during code compilation, educing the overhead typically
    associated with such runtime decisions without relying on heuristics. Its design is
    not only targeted but also expandable, allowing for future enhancements and broader
    applications in compiler optimization. MLGO exemplifies the innovative intersection
    of machine learning and compiler technology.

  features:
    - "Embedded Policy for Compilation Decisions"
    - "Improvement on Register Allocation"
    - "Extensible Framework"
