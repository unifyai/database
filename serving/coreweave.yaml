    Coreweave is a specialized cloud service for GPU acceleration. It allows users to
    run jobs on bare metal nodes while fully managing Kubernetes, eliminating the need
    for users to manage any infrastructure. This combines the ease of use of serverless
    architectures with the fast performance of Kubernetes. It supports autoscaling and
    spins up new instances in seconds. All that users need to provide is a Docker
    container and Coreweave automates the rest.

  features:
    - "Hybrid of bare metal and serverless architectures"
    - "Performance of bare metal setups with ease of use of serverless architectures"
    - "Supports autoscaling and spins up new instances in seconds"
