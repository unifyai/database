    BigDL is a set of toolkits developed by Intel to seamlessly scales data analytics &
    AI applications to be run easily on both laptops to cloud infrastructures.
    The project introduces the following set of libraries:
    - [LLM](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/tree/main/python/llm): Low-bit (INT3/INT4/INT5/INT8) large language model library for Intel CPU/GPU
    - [Orca](https://bigdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/Orca/index.html): Distributed Big Data & AI (TF & PyTorch) Pipeline on Spark and  Ray
    - [Nano](https://bigdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/Nano/index.html): Transparent Acceleration of Tensorflow & PyTorch Programs on Intel CPU/GPU
    - [DLlib](https://bigdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/DLlib/index.html): “Equivalent of Spark MLlib” for Deep Learning
    - [Chronos](https://bigdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/Chronos/index.html): Scalable Time Series Analysis using AutoML
    - [Friesian](https://bigdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/Friesian/index.html): End-to-End Recommendation Systems
    - [PPML](https://bigdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/PPML/index.html): Secure Big Data and AI (with SGX Hardware Security)"
