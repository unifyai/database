  description: |
    AIMET is a library that provides advanced model quantization and compression
    techniques for trained neural network models. It provides features that have been
    proven to improve run-time performance of deep learning neural network models with
    lower compute and memory requirements and minimal impact to task accuracy.

  features:
    - "Batch-Norm Folding"
    - "Cross-Layer Equalization"
    - "AdaRound"
    - "Channel Pruning"
    - "Singular Vector Decomposition"
