  description: |
    SparseML is an open source library developed and maintained by
    [Neural Magic](https://neuralmagic.com/) for applying compression recipes to neural
    networks.

    Currently, it supports pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation for
    compressing Vision, NLP, and now, large language models as well. SparseML also
    provides pre-compressed and pre-quantized models in their SparseZoo.

  features:
    - "Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP)"
    - "Alternating Compressed/DeCompressed Pruning (AC/DC)"
    - "Optimal BERT Surgeon (oBERT)"
    - "Pre-Compressed models via SparseZoo"
    - "Knowledge Distillation Recipes"
