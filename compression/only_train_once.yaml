    OTO is an automatic, architecture agnostic DNN training and compression
    (via structured pruning and erasing operators) framework. By OTO, users
    could train a general DNN either from scratch or a pretrained checkpoint
    to achieve both high performance and slimmer architecture simultaneously
    in the one-shot manner (without fine-tuning).
