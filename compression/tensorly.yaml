  description: |
    TensorLy is a Python library that aims at making tensor learning simple and accessible.
    It allows simple performing of tensor decomposition, tensor learning and tensor algebra.
    Its backend system allows to seamlessly perform computation with NumPy, PyTorch,
    JAX, MXNet, TensorFlow or CuPy, and run methods at scale on CPU or GPU.

  features:
    - "Tensor Algebra"
    - "Tucker Decomposition"
    - "Canonical Polyadic Decomposition"
    - "Tensor Train Decomposition"
    - "Parafac Decomposition"
