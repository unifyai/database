  description: |
    Core ML provides a unified representation for all models. Your app uses Core ML APIs
    and user data to make predictions, and to fine-tune models, all on the user’s device.
    Running a model strictly on the user’s device removes any need for a network connection,
    which helps keep the user’s data private and your app responsive.
    Core ML optimizes on-device performance by leveraging the CPU, GPU, and Apple Neural Engine (ANE)
    while minimizing its memory footprint and power consumption.

  features:
    - "Pruning"
    - "Palettization"
    - "Quantization"
