  description: |
    AWS Inferentia, developed by AWS, is a specialized machine learning chip crafted for
    delivering top-tier inference with remarkable performance. Essentially in
    architecture the Infertia devices are just a composition of multiple different
    accelerator engines like ScalarEngine for scalar-computations , VectorEngine for
    Vector computations , TensorEngine for tensor operations in design it’s very complex
    but very similar to the systolic array architecture in Google TPU’s. AWS Inferentia
    2 is very similar to Inferentia 1 in architecture the notable difference  being it
    has 4 times more memory capacity, 16.4 times higher memory bandwidth along with
    higher generation PCIE for faster data exchange.

  features:
    - "Easy to deploy via aws cloud services."
    - "Suppourt for multiple diffrent frameworks MXNet , TensorFlow and PyTorch."
    - "Great for inference tasks."
