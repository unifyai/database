    Mythic goes beyond conventional digital architectures, memory, and calculation
    elements and features the Mythic Analog Matrix Processors (Mythic AMP™), which
    offers significant advantages in power, performance, and cost. Mythic’s unique
    analog compute architecture performs trillions of operations required for AI
    inference inside dense flash-memory arrays.

  features:
    - "Power-efficient: Best-in-class TOPS/W."
    - "Analog Matrix Processor."
    - "Trained neural networks to ease deployment in edge devices."
