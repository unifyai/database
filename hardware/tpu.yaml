  description: "Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) developed by Google specifically for accelerating machine learning workloads, particularly those that involve training and running deep neural networks. TPUs are optimized for matrix multiplication / linear algebra operations, which are fundamental to many deep learning algorithms. TPUs employ a systolic array architecture which is essentially just a large physical matrix. Software designed for TPUs necessitates compilation through the Accelerator Linear Algebra (XLA) compiler. XLA operates as a just-in-time compiler, processing the graph generated by an ML framework application and converting the linear algebra, loss, and gradient elements of the graph into TPU machine code."
