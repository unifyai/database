    WebGPU is a groundbreaking browser standard set to transform web applications, with
    the shared goal of significantly boosting their efficiency and performance to rival
    native applications, all while ensuring compatibility across diverse hardware
    platforms. WebGPU, building on lower-level graphics APIs, introduces more extensive
    GPU-accelerated computing capabilities, surpassing its predecessor, WebGL, and
    enabling web applications to leverage modern graphics hardware for tasks like
    rendering 3D graphics and data processing. WebAssembly, or WASM, complements this
    effort by unlocking CPU-based computing capabilities, running near-native code in
    web applications, improving responsiveness, and is already integrated into most
    modern web browsers. Visit (https://caniuse.com/?search=webgpu) to see if your
