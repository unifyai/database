    The CS-2 system represents a holistic solution encompassing innovations in three fundamental domains. First, it features the second-generation Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2), setting a new standard as the industry's largest and only processor with multi-trillion transistors. Secondly, The CS-2 incorporates the Cerebras software platform, Working well with all of the tools Cerebras SDK has to offer.

    Compared to clusters of GPUs — which can take weeks or months to set up, require extensive parameter tuning to get functioning correctly, occupy dozens of datacenter racks and require proprietary InfiniBand to cluster — the CS-2 takes minutes to set up. Simply plug in the standardsbased 100 Gigabit Ethernet links to a switch, and you you can start training your models.

  features:
    - "Less energy usage compared to other accelerator chips."
    - "Easy to setup."
    - "Works well with Cerebras software platform."
