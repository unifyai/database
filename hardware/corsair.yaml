    Corsair hardware involves a groundbreaking technique that shifts computational tasks
    into Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), fundamentally transforming the interaction
    between memory and computing. Corsair utilizes a distinctive DIMC engine, consisting
    of tailored digital circuits, to seamlessly integrate computing functionalities
    within programmable memory. Corsair achieves this by introducing a multiplying
    component through the incorporation of four additional transistors into a 6T SRAM
    bit cell. The most important part of the chip design is the DIMC engine which is a
    digital version of in-memory compute.

  features:
    - "Optimized for generative inference."
    - "Frictionless and Scalable."
    - "software easily integrates into inference servers."
