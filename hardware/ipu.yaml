    Graphcore's IPU (Intelligence Processing Unit) is a type of specialized hardware
    accelerator designed for machine learning workloads. The IPU is optimized for highly
    parallelized and computationally intensive deep learning tasks, making it
    well-suited for training and inference in neural networks. Graphcore's IPU has a
    unique architecture, which is specifically designed to handle the irregular and
    sparse data patterns often encountered in deep learning models where traditional
    GPUs fall short. The IPU comes in different generations, such as the IPU-M2000 and
    IPU-POD, each offering various levels of performance and scalability for AI
    applications.

    The IPU is built around a tile architecture, which consists of multiple processing
    nodes connected in a two-dimensional grid. Each tile includes a number of processor
    cores, a local memory, and a router for communication between tiles.

  features:
    - "Easy to deploy via IPU cloud services."
    - "Flexible pricing for usage."
    - "Designed for fine-grained, high-performance computing."
