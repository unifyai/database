    Tenstorrent is an innovative hardware manufacturer focused on developing processors
    featuring a unique grid architecture called Tensix cores. These Tensix cores consist
    of a sophisticated combination of components, including five RISC processors, an
    array math unit dedicated to tensor operations, a SIMD (Single Input Multiple Data)
    unit for efficient vector operations, specialized hardware for accelerating network
    packet processing and compression/decompression tasks, and a generous cache of 1-2
    megabytes of SRAM memory. The unique thing about Tenstorrent boards is that they can
    be used similar to a GPU and can be inserted into any Gen4 x16 PCIe slot on the
    motherboard.

  features:
    - "Similar to a GPU in abstraction."
    - "Capable of executing large tensor computations efficiently."
    - "Capable of interfacing to other frameworks via ONNX."
    - "Dynamic sparsification (enabled in the software layer) are able to provide much higher throughput as compared to a GPU."
