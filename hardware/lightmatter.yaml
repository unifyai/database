    Lightmatter is delivering a new paradigm in semiconductor chip architecture and the
    next transition for large-scale computing. The company has developed photonic
    processors that are faster, more efficient and cooler than any conventional
    processors in existence today and is answering the call for increased compute speed,
    low energy density, and reduced chip heating. Lightmatter is set to enable the
    continued rapid growth of artificial intelligence computing while minimizing its
    well-known and growing impact on the environment.

  features:
    - "A general-purpose machine learning accelerator that combines photonics and transistor-based systems."
    - "Power efficient."
    - "Low cost."
    - "Wafer-scale processing with heterogeneous tiles of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, DRAM, and ASICs."
