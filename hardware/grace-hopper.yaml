  description: |
    The Grace Hopper Superchip by NVIDIA is a cutting-edge architectural innovation that
    merges the remarkable computing power of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU with the adaptability
    and performance of the NVIDIA Grace CPU. This integration is made possible through
    the utilization of a high-speed NVIDIA NVLink Chip-2-Chip (C2C) interconnect,
    facilitating rapid data exchange and shared memory between the GPU and CPU
    components. This powerful combination along with a large amount of
    high-bandwidth-memory (HBM) enables seamless cooperation between these processing
    units and enhances overall system performance. The NVLink Switch System optimizes
    data transfers and coordination among various components, thereby further improving
    the efficiency and speed of data processing within the system.

    The NVIDIA Grace CPU provides up to 512 GB of LPDDR5X memory, which delivers the
    optimal balance between memory capacity, energy efficiency, and performance. It
    supplies up to 546 GB/s of LPDDR5X memory bandwidth, which NVLink-C2C makes
    accessible to the GPU at 900 GB/s total bandwidth.

  features:
    - "less energy usage compared to other accelerator chips."
    - "easy to program."
    - "extended GPU memory (EGM)"
