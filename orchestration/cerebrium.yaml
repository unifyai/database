    Cerebrium simplifies the process of training, deploying, and monitoring machine
    learning models using a minimal amount of code.

    It offers seamless deployment with support for major ML frameworks, including
    PyTorch, ONNX, and HuggingFace models, as well as prebuilt models optimized for
    sub-second latency.

    Additionally, it provides effortless model fine-tuning and monitoring capabilities
    with integration into top ML observability platforms, enabling alerts about feature
    or prediction drift, model version comparisons, and in-depth insights into model
    performance.

  features:
    - "Serverless GPU Model Deployment."
    - "Support for All Major Frameworks."
    - "Automatic Versioning."
